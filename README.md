# Send-email-with-attachment-from-excel-using-python
The following was created for my gradbook team to send photos to all the students of my batch via gmail using the details given in the excel sheet.
test.py is the python file used for this purpose whereas the access_file.py was used to check whether the attachements specified for each student in the excess sheet is present at the specified location. If not those imgage pdfs (attachements) will be listed and you just have add those image pdfs to the directory. So, first, you have to run the access_file.py and then the test.py
Please keep a note of these factors before running the code:
1. changing the location paths based on your computer.
2. To turn on https://devanswers.co/allow-less-secure-apps-access-gmail-account/ feature on the gmail used to send the emails.
